# Getting Started

---

### This is a Markdown Text File that previously had some boilerplate tutorials on how to use these libraries. 

With this project, I aimed to make a student management system similar to the one used by school districts to manage students and courses.

Right now, the system is built on **Maven** and currently has a CRUD database that is used to create, read, update, and delete students/courses.

# Bugs
- Courses not appearing on Courses page
- Many-to-Many relationship database is glitching up too much to make it pragmatic to implement
