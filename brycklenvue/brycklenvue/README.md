# Getting Started

### This is a Markdown Text File that previously had some boilerplate tutorials on how
### to use these libraries. 

With this project, I aimed to make a student management system similar to the one used by school districts to manage student grades and courses.

Right now, the system is built on **Maven** and currently has a CRUD database that is used to create, read, update, and delete students.
